- Left off trying to get the wheels to rotate and the robot to move forward.
- Working on the `wmr-spheres.xml` model file to get the robot to simulate properly.
- Working on the `twmr.py` environment file to get observations and rewards set up properly.
- Need to get the initial position from the xml and save it for use in resetting the environment.
- The MuJoCo [basic tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/python/tutorial.ipynb#scrollTo=3KJVqak6xdJa)
